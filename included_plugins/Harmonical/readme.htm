<P><FONT FACE="arial">This plugin is more of an experiment than
anything else, part of my quest to create an instrument where the
visuals are intimately connected to the audio. Basically it's a
16-voice synth, where the sound source is a set of waveforms derived
from the vertices of a sphere, and added together. The vertices of
the sphere are then modulated used spherical harmonics (see
<A HREF="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/surfaces/sphericalh/">http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/surfaces/sphericalh/</A>),
with the result that very complex sounds are generated. It's very
heavy on the processor, and I'm sure it aliases all over the place.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="arial">The best way to get a hang of it is just to
play with it awhile. One thing to watch out for is the values of the
odd-numbered M controls &ndash; if you set these too high (4's a
reasonable limit), the thing goes a bit crazy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="arial"><B>Note for OS X Users:</B> Unfortunately the
plugin does not work correctly in Tracktion on OS X (the plugin
window cannot be closed or moved out of the way). This is because
Tracktion handles plugin windows on OS X differently to every other
host &ndash; there doesn't seem to be any way around this on my part,
I'm afraid. Also, sorry about the high cpu usage &ndash; it doesn't
seem to be nearly as high on my Windows machine, but I honestly don't
know why there's such a disparity.</FONT></P>
